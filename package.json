  "description": "On FEB 24, 2022, Russia (with Belarus as an ally) has launched an abhorrent military campaign to conquer Ukraine. Russia is using everything it has to break the will of Ukrainians, not shying away from commiting war crimes. Ukrainian cities are being bombarded at this very moment with vacuum bombs (aka MOAB), cruise missiles, cluster rockets, artillery and tanks. Innocent civilians and children are dying. We will not give up our freedom to the Kremlin lunatic.",
